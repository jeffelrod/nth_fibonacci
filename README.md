# nth_fibonacci
Given N, return the Nth Fibonacci number.

This repository will eventually contain files in multiple programming languages, including their caveats. 

# Javascript
Can run this via the command line, using $ node nth_fibonacci.js N, where N is the ordinal for the Fibonacci number you want to return. Only works up to N=79, because, the maximum safe integer in Javascript is +/-9007199254740991 (2<sup>53</sup> - 1). See [Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER) in the MDN Javascript docs for more info.
